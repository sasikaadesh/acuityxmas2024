Hi Sasika, 

Thank you so much for your patience. We’ve received below feedback on the content. 

Should we bring the cost reimbursement part as the last point. (order to be door should be operational, best 3 will win and then about cost). 
Can we bold or highlight Carols bit in the flyer (Carols not getting enough attention)
Maybe we can make the font color of the rules in black and make carols in red. 

Can you please change the content as below to get it fixed. Also, could you please do the needful for the feedback on font as well?

Let’s get into the spirit of Christmas this season and deck your room doors in all that is Christmas by the 10th December . 
The doors have to be operational after the décor is completed. Best 3 doors will win prizes. up to LKR5,000 will be reimbursed towards the décor costs when bills are submitted

Thanks a ton.
Regards, 
Desika Hureekaduwa
